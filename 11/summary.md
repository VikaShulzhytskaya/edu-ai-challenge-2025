A 25-year-old healthy male student and part-time postman presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, occurring intermittently for three days. The pain worsens with coughing and lying down but improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10, sometimes radiating to his neck. He denies shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other symptoms. He recently recovered from the flu but currently has no viral symptoms. There is no significant past medical history, medication use (except occasional Tylenol), allergies, surgeries, or substance use.

Notably, his father had a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, which causes him significant anxiety about his symptoms. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart function and reassure him. The patient is advised not to worry excessively until test results are available.
