Hello! I have a part of code, that I need to analyze from three expert perspectives
1) as an experienced JS developer
2) as a security engineer
3) as a performance specialist
Please provide distinct and relevant feedback for each of the three roles, cover the specified focus areas for each role and offer actionable and specific recommendations, not just generic statements.

Here is the code:
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
